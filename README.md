This project was set up for a university course named responsible AI. It assesses a dataset on fairness, it also mitigates unfairness. It also contains a part on explainable AI, in which it gives a better insight into why a decision was made.

A [pdf](https://github.com/wilfred11/rai-assign2/blob/master/rai-assign2-wvc.pdf) gives a better idea on the contents of this repository.
